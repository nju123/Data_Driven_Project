“We have a clear challenge from Israel to President Biden and in particular, Benjamin Netanyahu,” Magnier said, referring to Netanyahu’s comments that Israel will invade Rafah, despite Biden’s protests. “This challenge comes from a position of strength, where Netanyahu is saying to Biden ‘You’ve lost the support of American Arabs, and if you stand against me, you will lose the support of Zionist [as well.]... are you going to risk this when you have strong opposition represented by [former US President] Donald Trump?... This is why Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t fear standing up and challenging Joe Biden.”

“He's basically saying to Joe Biden, ‘Keep your mouth shut. It’s much better [that way] because I am doing what I want. Anything you are saying or planning or putting red lines does not work for us, because at the end of the day, we have our own plan,” Magnier added.

Those plans, Magnier fears, include the elimination of Palestine entirely. “Once [Israel’s campaign in Gaza] is over and when Gaza will be under Israeli military control, the next step is to say to the Palestinians, 'okay, we've given you enough time to play around. Now… forget about anything that is called a Palestinian state.' That is the inevitable step that Israel is going to take after Gaza.”

2,1768436766560936192,395034241,8064,,True,"Dunkley opportunity missed, Early federal election likely
David Flint The Spectator Australia 16 March 2024 

Apart from the election of the next US president and leader of the West, the most important issue facing Australia now is replacing the Albanese government before even more damage is done and we end up as Argentina did; moving from being one of the world’s most advanced countries to joining the third world.

While Dunkley was an improvement for the Liberals on last year’s Aston by-election, a swing from a minus 6.4 per cent to a plus 3.6 per cent, the result was significantly better for the Prime Minister than it should have been, especially after the Voice referendum.

Indeed, Labor is now understandably tempted to go to an early election.

The big issue at Dunkley was surely the cost of living, the reason why Labor manipulated the tax cuts to pretend something was being done. As noted here last week, the Coalition had an extraordinary stroke of good luck in the news before the vote, but failed to use it.

According to OECD statistics, from being a world leader, Australia suffered the developed world’s biggest drop in living standards in two decades, underperforming all comparable countries by almost 8 per cent.

And all this occurred under the Albanese government. Curiously, this news was restricted to this journal along with the Australian Financial Review, https://t.co/kKbr5txL3M, ADH TV, and 2GB, 4BC and 2CC.

Speaking from experience, what the Liberals should obviously have done was what Australians for Constitutional Monarchy did in the republic referendum – deliver what republican opponents admitted was a ‘killer slogan’, one ensuring victory. In Dunkley, such a slogan could have been: IT’S OFFICIAL! UNDER AIRBUS-ALBO, AUSSIES SUFFER WORLD’S BIGGEST DROP IN LIVING STANDARDS!

In addition, the news was in that Indonesia had outpriced our nickel industry by using Australian coal instead of expensive and unreliable so-called renewables.

Now, as they prepare for a general election, the Liberals must be better prepared and return to principles. While the Prime Minister says the election won’t be this year, his mantra ,‘My word is my bond’, is demonstrably valueless.

A standard house and half-senate election could be held as early as 3 August this year and as late as 17 May next year.

If the proposed royal visit goes ahead, don’t be surprised if the Prime Minister wrings every advantage out of it, even an early election. Ignore his frequent claim, ‘I’m a republican’. Like most of those who chant this, he’s a fake republican. His preferred republican model will not improve, but will rather significantly decrease, the checks and balances on the politicians, and especially, on a shady prime minister.

ACM’s tongue-in-cheek longstanding advice to monarchists captures this fake republican  hypocrisy.

‘Never stand between republicans and visiting royalty, else you’ll be knocked over in the rush.’(I have actually experienced something just like this.) Much depends on the hoped-for return to health for the King.

As to the timing, it is likely to be before  Chogm in Samoa on 21 October. No doubt the very able NSW Racing’s Peter V’landys has already invited the King,  Queen and Prime Minister to the glittering King Charles III Stakes at Royal Randwick  on 12 October.

If, sadly, the King cannot come, perhaps Prince William and Kate can.

So don’t be surprised by an election this year on any Saturday, especially on or after 26 October.

Returning to the 1999 referendum campaign, what republicans have admitted is that the campaign proposed by ACM’s Victorian Director, Rick Brown, ‘VOTE NO TO THE POLITICIANS REPUBLIC’ was indeed a ‘killer slogan’, lifting the No vote, even in Victoria. This exposed the crucial point that, unlike the governor-general, the president in the Keating-Turnbull model would be powerless to act, even where a prime minister was acting unconstitutionally.

In the coming election campaign, the Liberal party must be sharper than they were at Dunkley. In a campaign, much depends on luck and manipulation, as well as planning and hard work.

When they tire of governments, people vote them out and the opposition, however worthy or unworthy, still wins.

And as for manipulation, the Liberals should expect not only manipulation by the incumbent government but also by the propagandising, left-leaning media. Not all such manipulation works, or works for long. It didn’t in the republic referendum.

But for five or six decades now, media manipulation and influence usually favour Labor. Part of the reason for this is the disappearance of the older families who once owned significant parts of the media.

Those who remain, especially the Murdochs, are more versatile as to whom they favour. These days the editors and journalists have filled much of the void left by owners.

When ‘the’ republic became an issue, most of the media supported it even though the model was seriously defective.

As the Australian’s Paul Kelly said, ‘The media has a vested interest in change – change equates to news and news is the life blood of the media’.

Finally, the Liberal party now looks as if it could walk into a trap over nuclear power.

They are right to do away with the ban. The danger is the spokesman, Ted O’Brien, sees it as the silver-bullet to achieve the unachievable, pointless net zero emissions. O’Brien has a record of seeking silver-bullet solutions. Chairman in 2005 to 2007 of the Australian Republican Movement, formed when Labor added ‘the’ republic to its platform, the ARM has for almost three decades constantly searched for some, if any, silver bullet to deliver the politicians’ republic.

The latest was Charles’ accession. ACM warned this would never take off. And it didn’t.

The federal Liberal policy on nuclear energy should be to remove the ban as every other  comparable country does. The choice of energy should be left to the local authorities and the people.",2024-03-15 00:39:15+00:00,35,False,750,,11,5,,2024 US President Election,en

 The former President of the United States, Donald Trump, has warned that if he does not win the November elections, it will prove bloody for the country.

 He said this while addressing an election rally in the US state of Ohio on March 16, 2024.

 He said that if it does not win the election, then there will be no re-election in this country.  I believe that November 5 will be the most important date in the history of our country.

 ""They want to silence me because I will never allow them to silence you, and ultimately they're not after me, they're after you, I'm just in the way,"" Trump said without naming anyone.  stand up.'

 ""Radical left-wing Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election and we will not let them rig the 2024 presidential election,"" Trump alleged.

 The former US president said, ""Whenever radical left-wing democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor.""

 'Because I am being indicted because of you and never forget that our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away yours.'

 Donald Trump said that ""China, Mexico are now building some big plants where they will make cars and they are thinking of selling these cars in the United States, without paying any taxes at the border.""",2024-03-17 20:42:29+00:00,0,False,528,,0,6,,2024 US President Election,en

It has been my observation through this Presidential process that our electorial system is entirely driven by money and where money is, corruption follows.

Candidates are not given an equal chance based on their qualification but it is how much money do they have to buy their way into the election.

I have found the entire Presidential election process is very complex and I would be willing to bet 95 to 98% of the American people do not understand it with all of the hoops candidates have to jump through and all of the money they have to pay in the election process where every state has different criteria for candidates entry onto their states ballots and electors are the only ones whose votes count not the individual  vote of the American people.

I believe our entire election process needs to re-examined and revised to make it less complex, more forth right, less prone to corruption,  and easier for every American to understand and know their vote is counted as individual votes and not a few people the state designates.

Donald Trump is suing ABC News and George Stephanopoulos, claiming the “This Week” host harmed his reputation by saying that Trump was found liable for raping E. Jean Carroll.

Donald Trump, who boasted how he likes to assault women (Grab them by the pu**y"") and was credibly accused by 26 women of sexual assault, was found liable by a Manhattan federal jury for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996.

While it's true that he wasn't technically found liable for rape, Judge Lewis Kaplan later clarified that because of New York’s narrow legal definition of “rape,” the jury’s finding did not mean that Ms. Carroll “failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape.’”

When Judge Kaplan dismissed Trump’s counter-defamation lawsuit against E. Jean Carroll in August, he made it very clear that Trump did rape her: ""Indeed, the jury’s verdict in Carroll II establishes, as against Mr. Trump, the fact that Mr. Trump ‘raped her,’ albeit digitally rather than with his penis. Thus, it establishes against him the substantial truth of Ms Carroll’s ‘rape’ accusations.”

In 2020, they released a super flu that they exaggerated the mortality of in an attempt to change the planet forever while rigging the presidential election.

They were, by every measure, successful. The rich got richer. The government got bigger and stronger, and Donald Trump was removed from office.

However, none of them expected President Trump to rise like a Phoenix in 2024. I believe they had anticipated being able to either intimidate him via lawfare or possibly even incarcerate him to prevent his ascension. A plan was hatched to sell the public a younger alternative without the baggage (Ron DeSantis).

The media, Wall Street, politicians, and mega donors were onboard with the plan. Obviously, that plan totally blew up in their faces as the Never Trump donors pissed through nearly half a billion dollars between Ron and Nikki. Both failed miserably.
